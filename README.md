# About this demo

This demo was made to exemplify what could be done with webapps for smartphones and tablets in 2013 â€“ as an alternative to native apps. 

It showed that well-programmed webapps fully compared to Native apps in terms of performance and integrations. Fx. this app had full offline support and camera integration and was loaded with animations and transitions performing equal to most native apps produced at the time.

The website may no longer be available online in it's original form. It is shared here, in this form, as an example of the frontend work I have done over the years.

This demo only exposes the source code that was online at the time of launch, and as such publicly available.
